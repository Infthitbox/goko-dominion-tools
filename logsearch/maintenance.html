        <h4>Goko Log Search</h4>

        <p>Search is busted.  Sorry.</p>
        
        <p>
        Possible reasons this may have happened:
        <ol>
            <li>Andrew just broke something -- he doesn't know the difference between a development server and a production server -- and is probably fixing it right now.  Try again in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The database couldn't take it anymore and went on vacation.  Try again in a few hours.</li>
            <li>You've found a new bug.  Congrats! Please report it through the forums or to andrewiemail@gmail.com.  Thanks.</li>
        </ol>
